# Simulating-the-Dynamic-Response-of-Current-Carrying-MEMS-Devices
The dynamical lumped parameter model arising
from current carrying, linear elastic MEMS
devices is non-linear. This is due to inverse
proportional force in the magnetic force of two
wires.

In this project, we proceed as follow:

i. Present the lumped mechanical model of
the system

ii. Drive the steady state equations

iii. Linearize the state equations around an
operating point

iv. Compare the linear and non-linearâ€™ s
pulse response

v. Specifics of the simulations

vi. Yield the second order perturbation
correction for the linear model and
compare it to the linear response
